# Post-Edit Verification

After editing any `.tsx` or `.ts` file in `app/`, `components/`, or `lib/`:

1. Run **`npm run check`** — runs TypeScript check and ESLint in one go.
2. If something fails, fix it. Use **`npm run check:fix`** to auto-fix lint issues where possible.
3. Do not consider the task complete until `npm run check` passes.

For React components: follow react-nextjs-patterns rule and use Next.js MCP docs when unsure about best practices.
